## Performance
 - Performance of the model was tested on 100 tweets containing emojis from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/rexhaif/emojifydata-en) dataset.
 - [This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705117304240) showed that emoticon blocking (using emoji sentiment as overall sentiment indicator for a sentence) proved to be an effective method of sentiment detection. 
 - This was tested and the results can be observed below.
### Emoticon Blocking
![emoticon-blocking](https://i.imgur.com/Sm3NUnQ.png)
 
 ### Text Only
 ![text-first](https://i.imgur.com/Uj7Bly0.png)

- Emoticon blocking appears to perform better on this small dataset which would suggest it would also perform better on a larger dataset. 
- Emoticon blocking also handles sarcasm where, for example, ```I hate it when you do that 😉``` is considered positive overall, where as it would be classified as negative if only the text was considered.

### C3D Image Sentiment Model
![accuracy](https://i.imgur.com/7Nx6BNi.png)
- 5000 images used in training with 2500 of each class.
- Model trained and evaluated on balanced data set using a training/validation split of 70/30.
- Below is an example of the top negative and positive images from the validation data.

#### Top Negative

## FAQ

- **How is sentiment calculated?**
	- Text, emojis and images are extracted from a chat sentence like the example given below.
    - ```we lost 😒 😅 😛 <img>https://media.giphy.com/media/2rtQMJvhzOnRe/giphy.gif</img>```
	- Sentiment for each is calculated and a score is returned based on the rules in SentimentAnalysis.calculate_scores().

- **How was the image model trained?**
	- The [C3D Model](https://gist.github.com/albertomontesg/d8b21a179c1e6cca0480ebdf292c34d2) was finetuned using imges from GIPHY.
	- Labelled GIPHY images were obtained from [GIFGIF](http://gifgif.media.mit.edu/labs/api).
	- An R script to extract the  links from JSON has been included in this project. 
	- Text files are generated containing links to the images which can be downloaded from terminal using ```cat file_name.txt | parallel --gnu "wget {}"```.
	- Or the exact files used for training and validation can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=117xkFzY2OiYMjf6PTPsKYSXENXnPIZVR).

- **Why is there no sentiment score for some emojis?**
	- In my opinion, not all emojis are good indicators of sentiment. 
	- Only emojis with obvious indicators of sentiment such as facial expressions, popular symbols and hand signs were used. 

- **But what about sarcasm detection?**
	- [*DeepMoji has learned to understand emotions and sarcasm based on millions of emojis*](https://deepmoji.mit.edu/).
	- Whether the text contains sarcasm or not is irrelevant, the features extracted using DeepMoji still accurately represent the emotions in the text. These features are used when finetuning new models. 
	- Using emoticon blocking also helps to calculate the actual sentiment in cases of sarcasm e.g. ```I hate it when you do that 😉``` is actually positive and contains a positive emoji but negative text.  Emoticon blocking considers the emoji as the overall sentiment which would be correct in this case.

- **Why was the model only evaluated on combinations of emojis and text?**
	- The sentiment of images is only used if there is no sentiment available for emojis or text in a sentence. The accuracy of this is the same as when the image model was evaluated individually.

## Additional Notes
- Sentiment analysis from sarcasm detection could be directly tackled using DeepMoji. DeepMoji  outlined in their paper to have been finetuned on [SCv2-GEN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05404.pdf) to perform sarcasm detection at 75% accuracy. Text could be first passed through this model to detect sarcasm and then the sarcastic sentences passed to another model finetuned on sentiment labelled sentences containing sarcasm. 

- In my opinion, this approach would not be very accurate as the compounding decrease in classification accuracy (is this sarcastic? -> is this positive/negative?) (75% x ??%) would most likely result in a poor result. There is also an increase in computational overhead which enforces the fact this trade off would most likely not be worthwhile.
